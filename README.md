*tiny-bootstrap

This is a tiny, fully working "bootloader" for x86 IBM-PC computers, which basically does nothing more than print some text to the screen. Mostly a teaching tool. Full writeup is available [on my blog](jophish.github.io/posts/post_two.html). If you just want to see it in action though, just run

     :::bash
     bochs -f bochsrc.txt

which runs bochs with the correct config file.
